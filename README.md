# 📊 Influence of Social Media on Mental Health – Analysis Using Python

## 🧠 Overview
This project explores the **impact of social media usage on mental health**, with a focus on identifying relationships between usage patterns and psychological outcomes such as **stress, anxiety, depression**, and **self-esteem**. Using Python, this research leverages data analysis and visualization to draw insights from collected survey responses.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the **correlation between frequency/type of social media use** and mental health indicators.
- Evaluate how **specific platforms** (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) affect users differently.
- Understand the role of **demographics** (age, gender) in mental health outcomes.
- Investigate user **perceptions** regarding the emotional impact of social media.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Survey-based responses from individuals aged 18–45 across urban populations.
- **Data Processing**: Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - Correlation and regression analysis
  - Sentiment analysis (if applicable)
  - Demographic segmentation
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of trends and mental health outcomes.

## 📈 Key Findings

- High frequency of **passive social media use** (scrolling) is positively correlated with **increased anxiety and depressive symptoms**.
- **Active engagement** (commenting, messaging) often leads to **higher perceived social support**.
- **Females and young adults** (18–25) are more likely to report negative emotional outcomes related to social comparison.
- **Instagram and TikTok** users reported greater body image concerns than Facebook users.
